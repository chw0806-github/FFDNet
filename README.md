# FFDNet for SAR image despeckling
Repository for the project of the class 'Remote sensing data'. Based upon the paper Zhang, K., Zuo, W., & Zhang, L. (2018). FFDNet: Toward a fast and flexible solution for CNN-based image denoising [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04026).

Authors: Bj√∂rn Michele, Lucas Elbert

Supervisors: Florence Tupin, Emanuele Dalsasso

How to run the project:
The project was developed and tested mainly using Google Colab to have GPU support.

1. Copy the project to a Google Drive
2. Open code/main_notebook.ipynb with Google Colab

To keep this repo in a reasonable size it only contains a portion of our training/evaluation data. The complete data can be found  [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z5IBPs_iBLQkji-2cyvx5qMmYI3l-apc]).
